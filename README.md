# Computer Graphics Pair Project
Graphic Renderer using C++
This is a part of COMS30115 Computer Graphics module from University of Bristol by jerrykress and dr17549.

This projects involves using GLM to write a renderer engine from scratch. This is by reading from an obj and mlt file to render 
a 3D image. This project intends to explore both raytracing and rasteriser approach. 
The wireframe renderer can also be seen as part of the project to ensure that the calculations are correct.

The rasteriser can only render colours without shadows of any object created from triangles. 

The raytracer is much more complex and invovles the following features: 
1. Hard shadows
2. Soft shadows
3. Mirrors
4. Complex Anti-aliasing
5. Global illumination 
6. Simple Animation 
7. Phong Shading
8. Perspective corrected texture mapping 

Please enjoy!
